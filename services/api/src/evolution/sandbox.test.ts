/**
 * What the probe hands down.
 *
 * The design is "probe once, on this side, and send the answer": the container
 * corrections have one owner, and asking twice in two languages is how two
 * answers start to disagree. That only holds if what is sent identifies the
 * binary that was tested — a bare name is resolved *again* on the other side,
 * against a different PATH.
