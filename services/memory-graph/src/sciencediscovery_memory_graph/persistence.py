"""Persistence helpers: upsert Task/ToolCall / Code / Artifact / Paper + ``produces`` edges.

Node labels: a subagent's scope is ``:Task`` (``task_type='subagent'``);
every execution/search node — whether session-main or a subagent's internal
child — is ``:ToolCall`` (``tool_type='execution'/'search'``, plus the evolve
marker ``'program_evolution'``; pre-rename nodes carry older values, see
``LEGACY_CLASSIFICATION_ALIASES`` in the web app);
``tool_name`` carries the full tool identifier such as
``mcp__arxiv__search``). MVP
(``code_id = executionId``), one Artifact node per logical artifact id
(latest fields; versioning is v2). All search/write paths run through the
unified ``upsert_tool_call``: one ToolCall per invocation (``task_id`` chosen
by the broker: ``subtask:mcp:<invocation_id>`` for MCP, ``subtask:web:<invocation_id>``
for the WebBroker, ``subtask:npu:<job_id>`` for NPU jobs, …) + per-product
Paper/WebPage/DbRecord nodes deduped on their composite keys. The legacy
``upsert_mcp_search`` / ``_upsert_mcp_search_child`` paths have been
retired; ``/observe/mcp-search`` no longer exists.
All writes are ``MERGE`` on the unique key so hooks are idempotent across
retries.

    ``produced_artifacts`` items carry ``artifact_id`` (the logical
    ScientificArtifact id), ``path``, ``version``, ``media_type``,
    ``logical_name``, ``turn_id`` (review routing key for the version node),
    ``content_hash`` (the produced artifact's CAS hash), and optionally
    ``input_artifact_versions`` — a list of ``{artifact_id, version}``
    composite-key pairs for the Artifact versions this Code run read as inputs
    (used to build ``input`` edges; absent when no inputs were read). All
    writes are MERGE; safe to retry.

    The five provenance fields' addressing info lands here: Code mirrors
    ``stdout_hash``/``stderr_hash``/``env_hash`` (CAS hashes for the
    executionLog/environments/code blocks) + ``turn_id``; SubTask mirrors
    ``turn_id`` (messages routing key — store filters manifests by turnId, the
    same key review uses, since manifest_ids would race manifest persistence at
    mirror time); each Artifact version node mirrors ``turn_id`` (review
    routing key) + ``content_hash``. None of these store content blobs — only
    hashes / routing keys, per the "graph = directory, CAS/store = warehouse"
    layering (see docs/memory-graph-provenance-fields.md §2).

    ``parent_subagent_id`` selects the write shape. When ``None`` (main-agent
    context), a per-execution SubTask ``subtask:<execution_id>`` is built and
    produces the Code/Artifact — the original main behavior, unchanged. When
    set (this execution ran inside a subagent), a *child* SubTask
    ``subtask:subagent:<id>:exec:<execution_id>`` is built (tool_type is the
    real ``execution`` — NOT ``subagent``), a ``contains`` edge links the
    subagent's scope node to this child, and produces edges run
    ``child → Code`` / ``child → Artifact`` (the scope never carries
    products). The child does not join the session temporal chain — only
    session-main SubTasks do.

    ``input_source_files`` is a distinct top-level input channel from the
    per-artifact ``input_artifact_versions`` above: it carries the SourceFile
    nodes (uploaded files) this Code run read, as ``{file_id}`` keys (SourceFile
    has no version, unlike Artifact). The recorder infers them by scanning the
    code text for uploaded-file paths (same grain as
    ``inferredArtifactInputs``). The ``input`` edge (SourceFile → Code) is built
    AFTER the produced_artifacts loop, anchored on the Code node — input is a
    property of the Code run ("what this run read"), not of any one produced
    artifact. MERGE on (file_id, code_id) keeps re-runs idempotent. Built only
    when the SourceFile node already exists (block 1's ``upsert_source_file``
    writes it fire-and-forget at upload time); a missing SourceFile MATCHes
    nothing and the edge is silently skipped — the same fire-and-forget
    degradation as the rest of the mirror.

    tool family. This is the only tool-call write path (the legacy
    ``upsert_mcp_search`` was retired; ``upsert_execution`` keeps the
    run_python/artifact path). Per product ``product_type`` the function
    fans out to one of three batches:

    - ``paper`` — session-scoped (session_id, link) MERGE,
      retrieval_count bumps on re-search;
    - ``web_page`` — WebPage MERGEd on the key the record carries: an
      identifier-bearing record (llm-wiki's wiki path) keys on
      ``(session_id, identifier)``; a url-only record (web_search) keys on
      ``(session_id, url)``. Two separate UNWIND batches run because the
      merge keys differ. A product may carry ``content_hash`` (the page body's
      address in the CAS data pool — the text is never stored on the node);
      ON MATCH uses COALESCE so a hash-less re-search after a fetch keeps the
      existing body, and ``has_full_content`` is the boolean flag the read
      side gates the body view on;
    - ``db_record`` — DbRecord MERGEd on the composite
      ``(session_id, source, identifier)`` (uniprot/pdb/…). The ``source``
      field participates only in the dedup key — the UI never renders it.

    ``parent_subagent_id`` (subagent context) reshapes the write: a *child*
    ToolCall ``subtask:subagent:<id>:exec:<task_id>`` is built, ``contains``
    links the subagent scope to it, and produces runs ``child → product``.

    - **Terminal phase** (``status`` in completed/failed/cancelled/timed_out):

    ``timed_out`` is normalised to ``failed`` (one red label) with
    ``failure_reason="timed_out"`` kept distinct. ``summary`` is guaranteed
    non-empty: on a successful terminal call with no text, the deterministic
    fallback ``"Subagent completed without a text response."`` is used (matches
    the placeholder the run itself publishes) so the scope node never carries
    an empty summary. The scope never carries products — each internal toolcall
    is a separate child ToolCall built by ``upsert_execution`` /
    ``upsert_tool_call`` (with ``parent_subagent_id``) and hung off this scope
    via ``contains``. The scope does join the session temporal chain (ordered

    The goal connects to the *first* node only; each node then links to the
    next by ``seq``. Ordering by ``seq`` (not ``finished_at``) means a node
    still running (no ``finished_at`` — e.g. a subagent scope mirrored at its

    Three source branches, mutually exclusive:

      by normalized link and store ``source_paper_link`` on the Evidence
      node. ``source_file_id`` and ``source_webpage_link`` are left null.
    - ``source_file_id`` set → the SourceFile-PDF branch (block 3): MATCH the
      SourceFile by ``file_id`` and store ``source_file_id`` on the Evidence
      node (NOT ``source_paper_link`` — see omission-1 note below).
      ``source_paper_link`` and ``source_webpage_link`` are left null.
    - ``source_webpage_link`` set → the WebPage branch: MATCH the WebPage by
      ``url`` OR ``identifier`` (web_search vs llm-wiki) and store the matched
      node's own key as ``source_webpage_link`` on the Evidence node.
      ``source_paper_link`` and ``source_file_id`` are left null. The value
      arrives raw (the LLM's input): the Cypher matches both the raw and the
      ``_normalize_link`` form (url variants normalize onto the upserted key;
      opaque llm-wiki identifiers only match raw). The server gate rejects
      pages without a ``content_hash`` (search returns snippets only) with
      ``source_webpage_no_content``; the chain lights up when a fetch/get_page
      tool lands the body in the CAS data pool and the upsert writes its hash.

    The caller (server.py /persist/evidence) validates the source exists AND
    enforces that a SourceFile used here is a PDF (``media_type=
    application/pdf``): a non-PDF data file is rejected at the server layer
    with ``source_file_not_pdf`` because data files are not "arguments
    extracted from a document" and must instead directly support a Claim via
    ``declare_claim``'s ``cites_source_file_refs``. This function assumes the
    caller already did that media_type gate. The WebPage branch similarly
    assumes the caller ran the content gate (rejects with
    ``source_webpage_no_content`` before this function is called).

    Omission-1 note: ``source_file_id`` is stored in its own field, never in
    ``source_paper_link``. ``_normalize_link`` would mangle a file_id
    (``source_file:session:abc:upload.pdf`` → ``https://source_file:...`` —
    urlsplit treats a scheme-less string as a path and prepends ``https``),
    and the frontend's EvidenceDetail renders ``source_paper_link`` as a
    clickable URL — a file_id is not a valid URL. A dedicated
    ``source_file_id`` field bypasses both.

    Evidence is not deduped — each declaration gets its own fresh
    ``evidence_id`` (Evidence has no content-based dedup rule). Returns the
    evidence_id, or ``None`` when skipped (graph disabled/unreachable).

    Claim) + optional ``stated_in`` (Claim → report Artifact).

    Claim is not deduped — each declaration gets a fresh ``claim_id`` (the
    canonical pattern uses ``CREATE``, and content_hash is stored only for
    indexing / future dedup). ``cites_node_ids`` are Evidence(evidence_id) —
    a Claim no longer cites a Paper directly (that edge was removed: a Claim
    reaches a Paper only via ``supports Evidence → extracts Paper``, walked
    backward). To cite a paper the LLM must first ``declare_evidence`` then
    cite the Evidence here. ``cites_artifact_refs`` is a list of
    ``{artifact_id, version}`` dicts — Artifact is keyed on the composite
    ``(artifact_id, version)`` (one node per version), so a cited figure/dataset
    is pinned to the exact version the LLM declared against (not the latest,
    which would drift as the product is regenerated). ``cites_source_file_refs``
    is a list of ``{file_id}`` dicts for uploaded non-PDF data files
    (CSV/image/etc) that directly support the claim — ``SourceFile -[:supports]->
    Claim`` — mirroring the Artifact path (data files are not "arguments
    extracted from a document", so they skip the Evidence layer). The caller
    (server.py) enforces that only non-PDF SourceFiles take this path (a PDF
    must go via declare_evidence first); this function assumes that gate ran.
    ``cites_db_record_refs`` is a list of ``{source, identifier}`` dicts for
    database records (uniprot/pdb/chembl/...) this session retrieved via
    db_search that directly back the claim — ``DbRecord -[:supports]-> Claim``,
    mirroring the Artifact path (a curated database record directly backs an
    assertion, so it skips the Evidence layer the way code-produced artifacts
    do). DbRecord is keyed on the composite ``(session_id, source, identifier)``,
    so the cites path passes both fields; the caller (server.py) resolved the
    LLM-supplied alias value to this triple and 422'd any ambiguity.
    ``artifact_id`` + ``artifact_version`` (the report Artifact + its version)
    build the ``stated_in`` edge (Claim → report Artifact) so the graph can
    navigate "which claim is stated in which report"; the caller verified the
    Artifact exists.

    Returns the cited targets ``[{evidence_id?, artifact_id?, version?,
    file_id?, source?, identifier?, labels?}]`` so the caller can assemble the
    chip_map (alias → node) returned to the LLM. The chip_map itself is not
    persisted here — it lives on the report Artifact version's ``references``
    (Node side). Empty list when skipped.

# --- Cleanup: session/project deletion mirrors --------------------------------

# Called by the sidecar's ``/cleanup/session`` and ``/cleanup/project``
# routes, which the Node API's deleteSession / deleteProject handlers invoke
# AFTER the store deletion has committed. Mirrors the upsert/declare contract:
# ``is_reachable()`` guard + ``with driver.session()`` + try/except log, and a
# degraded (unreachable) graph returns a ``{status:"degraded"}`` shell rather
# than erroring — the HTTP deletion response must never be blocked by a
# mirror-layer cleanup (the store op already succeeded; the graph is a
# directory, the store is the warehouse).

    Artifact is a project-scoped asset that survives in the store, and a
    future cross-session run may still reference this version via an ``input``
    edge or walk the ``supersedes`` chain — so the version node must remain
    matchable. Evidence / Claim use fresh uuids (never deduped), so a
    physical delete is permanent and intended (a declaration has no meaning
    once its producing session's transcript is gone).

    ``DETACH DELETE`` on the private nodes drops their in/out edges too,
    including the Claim endpoint of ``stated_in`` (the report version node is
    soft-marked but its stated_in inbound edge is severed — expected: the
