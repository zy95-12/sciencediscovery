"""A ``prompt -> text`` completion, routed through the control plane.

**Why not `agentdescent.agents.openai_compatible`.** It builds the same request
and normalises the same reply — including the `content: null` a reasoning model
returns when its whole budget went to hidden thinking — and this file would be a
few lines long if it could be used. It cannot, for one reason: it reads the base
URL and the API key **from the environment**. This process is handed a
run-scoped proxy token instead of a provider key, one per search, and putting
those in `os.environ` would leak them into the candidate: the Seatbelt sandbox
passes `{**os.environ, ...}` to the subprocess, so a model-written program would
be able to read the token for its own run. Passing credentials per call is the
whole point, so the request is built here.

What *is* reused rather than rebuilt: `agentdescent.agents.Usage` counts the
tokens (see `_Usage` in `puct_engine.py`), and `with_retries` wraps this.

    """Build the callable the engine calls once per mutation.

    ``endpoint`` is absolute and comes from the control plane, which knows its
    own bind address. A sidecar that had to guess it would turn every expansion
    into a failed candidate for a reason that has nothing to do with candidates.

    ``on_usage`` receives what the provider reported, so the token budget gate
    reads what was actually spent rather than an estimate — and so an empty reply
    can be told apart from an exhausted one. The returned callable takes its own
    sink as well: with N expansions in flight there is no such thing as "the last
    call", and blaming one expansion's empty reply on another's token count is
    worse than not explaining it at all.

    ``should_stop`` makes a call abandonable. Without it a stop waits out the
    request, and on a reasoning model rewriting a program that is minutes: the
    user presses stop and watches nothing happen. The request itself cannot be
    cancelled, so it is left to finish on a daemon thread and its answer is
    dropped — the call is already paid for either way, and the difference is
    whether the user is made to wait for it.

    ``thinking`` is sent as ``{"type": ...}`` when set, and comes from the goal
    rather than being decided here — it is a trade the user makes, measured on
    GLM5.2 rewriting a small program: on, ~46k output tokens per call and a
    held-out test score of 0.519; off, ~1.2k and 0.366. Forty times the tokens
    and five times the wall clock for better candidates.

    Leaving it unset sends nothing, which is what a provider that has never
    heard of the field should receive. The option is one-sided anyway: an
    endpoint that does not know it ignores it.

    ``temperature`` is the same story: left unset, nothing is sent and the
    provider's own default applies — observed necessary on a deployment whose
    gateway rejects every value except the one it was configured with
    (``HTTP 400 invalid temperature: only 0.6 is allowed for this model``),
    which turned every mutation call into a failed candidate. A caller that
    wants a specific value can still pass one.

    ``max_tokens`` defaults high because a reasoning model with thinking left on
    spends the budget on hidden tokens and returns an empty reply — and an empty
    reply becomes a failed node, which is indistinguishable from a candidate that
    genuinely would not run. The pre-flight checks refuse a run whose ceiling is
    too low for that reason.
