"""Fidelity of the vendored port, pinned against upstream's own fixtures.

Moved here from `agentdescent/tests/test_puct_example.py` together with the code
it checks. **Vendoring the port without these would discard the only thing that
makes vendoring better than re-implementing**: the claim that this is the same
algorithm, checkable rather than asserted.

The first two use the fixtures from google-research/era's `futs_test.py`. The
third is the one that matters most: it drives this port's tree and a line-by-line
transcription of upstream's `futs.search` with the same mock generator and
executor, and asserts they expand the same node at every step and end with the
same visit vector.
