"""What confines a candidate, checked against the kernel.

The gate allows scikit-learn, so the gate cannot be the boundary — which makes
the first test here the one that decides whether any of this is safe to run.
It does not read the profile back and agree with itself; it runs a probe under
the real profile and asserts the operating system refused what the profile
claims to refuse.
