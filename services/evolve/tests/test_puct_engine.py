"""The PUCT search, with the model and the measurement substituted.

Everything between them is the shipping path and is not mocked: `PuctTree`,
`PuctStrategy`, `PuctTreeAggregator`, a real `Ledger` (a real git repo), and
`evolve` / `async_evolve` themselves. What these tests are for is the contract
the rest of the system reads — which events come out, in what order, carrying
what — and that it survives being driven by the framework rather than by a loop
of ours.
