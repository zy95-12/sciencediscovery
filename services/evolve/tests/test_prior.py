"""The PUCT prior: `P(s, a)` from the model's own rating of a direction.

AlphaZero fills this slot with a policy network. A program search has none,
which is why upstream's default is a uniform ``1/N`` -- but the model writing
the candidates is somebody to ask, and it answers in the reply the search was
already paying for.

**The formula is not ours.** `FlatPuct._priors` lives in `agentdescent`
(0.4.6+) and this port supplies the number it reads. So what is checked here is
the wiring: that the rating survives the trip from the reply to `Candidate.prior`
without being invented, dropped, or turned into a zero. The one arithmetic test
below pins the property the whole design leans on -- ``prior_exponent=0`` is
upstream to the floating-point bit.
