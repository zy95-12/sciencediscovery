"""One real search, over HTTP, with only the model faked.

Everything else is the shipping path: the FastAPI route, the event stream, the
PUCT tree, the mutation prompt, the AST gate, the real sandbox, the vendored
runner, pandas inside it, the metric computed outside it, the scorecard and
`DefaultAcceptance`. The model is a local HTTP server returning a canned
program, because a test that needed a provider key would not run.

This is the test that answers "does a search actually work", which no amount of
unit tests can: every one of them substitutes the two things most likely to be
wired up wrong.
