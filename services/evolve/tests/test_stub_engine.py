"""The stub engine's event sequence is a fixture, so it is pinned here.

Everything downstream (run lifecycle, SSE bridge, graph mirror, dashboard,
search canvas) is built and tested against this sequence before a real engine
exists, so a change to it is a change to every one of those tests. If a change
is intended, update the expected shape here in the same commit.
