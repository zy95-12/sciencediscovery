"""Scoring by an evaluator the drafting model wrote.

The interesting tests are the contract, because the contract is what a model
has to get right without being able to try it first: the candidate is importable
under the name it was promised, the shard list arrives, the result is read from
the file rather than from stdout, and every way the evaluator can be wrong says
which of the two programs is at fault.
