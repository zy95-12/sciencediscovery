/**

 * directory, reached only over HTTP. Nothing here touches SSH — the tunnel is a
 * transport detail, while what has to hold is that a Runner which never shared a
 * filesystem with the control plane ends up holding the same bytes and answers
 * with a path of its own.
 *
 * Mounting those packages and running their scripts needs a real sandbox, which
 * an ordinary CI host cannot create, so that half lives beside the sandbox in
 * `services/runner` (`skill-packages.test.ts`). Do not bring an execution back
 * into this file: this package is host tier.
