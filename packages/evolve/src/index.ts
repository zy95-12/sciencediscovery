/**
 * `/evolve-design` as a capability package: the two LLM tools and nothing else.
 *
 * Registered the way `plan` is — the composition root builds the runtime
 * and hands it over once; a deployment that does not build one simply gets no
 * tools. Before this, `WorkspaceAgentOptions` declared the two callbacks,
 * `createWorkspaceTools` constructed the tools, `buildTools` forwarded the two
 * fields by hand, and `EvolveToolDeps` was threaded through `executeAgentRun`,
 * `scheduleSessionRuns` and `streamAgentRun`. Five places had to agree, and
 * when one of them silently did not — an upstream route added a
 * `scheduleSessionRuns` call site without the deps — both tools vanished from
 * that path with no type error and no failing behaviour, only a missing
 * capability. Four of those five places are gone; the fifth — one factory,
 * still positional through the run layer — is declared required-but-nullable
 * there, so the omission that used to be silent is now a compile error.
 *
 * The runtime is per turn, not per process: `emit`, `beginExternalWait` and
 * `sessionId` all belong to the turn that is running. That is why the export
 * is a factory over a runtime rather than a value like `planRepository`.
