/**
 * The dashboard's four blocks, at the level where they can be wrong silently.
 *
 * The chart's job is to keep three measurements apart; the stream's is to name
 * which of four things happened to a candidate; the diff's is to show the few
 * lines that changed inside a program that grew. Each of those is a pure
 * function underneath, and each fails by drawing something plausible.
