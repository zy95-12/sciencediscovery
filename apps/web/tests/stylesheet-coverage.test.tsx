/**
 * Every class the evolve screens put on an element has a rule behind it.
 *
 * This has now failed silently twice, the same way both times: a wholesale
 * block replacement in `evolve.css` swallowed neighbouring rules, the markup
 * kept referencing the class, and the element rendered bare. The correction
 * box became a two-row postage stamp; the artifact page's "make this better"
 * button was crushed by its flex row into one character per line. Nothing
 * type-checks a className against a stylesheet, no unit test renders CSS, so
 * the only detector was a person looking at the screen — the slowest and most
 * annoyed detector there is.
 *
 * The check is textual on purpose: no DOM, no build. A class is "covered" when
 * it appears as a selector token anywhere in the stylesheet bundle. That is
 * deliberately weak — it cannot see a wrong rule, only a vanished one — and a
 * vanished one is exactly the accident this exists to catch.
