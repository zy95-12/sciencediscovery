# Assemble the runtime payload embedded in one release binary.
#
# The payload carries the product's own pieces: Node, CPython, the built Web
# assets, the deployed Node services and micromamba. It deliberately does NOT
# carry uv or the gateway's third-party Python dependencies — the launcher
# restores those on the user's machine at first launch, from a configurable
# package index (Huawei Cloud mirror by default), pinned here to exact
# versions: a hash-locked requirements export of services/gateway/uv.lock and
# a sha256-pinned uv wheel.
#
# JiuwenSwarm and its adapter ARE embedded (unlike the gateway): both are
# installed at build time into flat, PYTHONPATH-addressable directories rather
# than a venv, because a venv's shebangs and pyvenv.cfg hardcode the build
# machine's absolute path and stop working once the payload is extracted
# somewhere else. The launcher invokes each by importing its entry-point
# module directly (see serve.ts) instead of running the (broken, if it even
# shipped) console-script wrapper. JiuwenSwarm is installed straight from its
# PyPI release ("workswarm"), not cloned: the pinned tag's PyPI publish
# resolves its own git-pinned transitive dependency (openjiuwen) as a plain
# PyPI version, so no cloning or wheel-building is needed for it or its
# dependencies. JiuwenSwarm's own dependency closure is large (some 1GB+:
# transformers, onnxruntime, playwright, ...), so this is the single biggest
# contributor to release size; see docs/en/getting-started/deployment.md for
# the trade-off this was chosen over (first-launch install, like the
# gateway's deps get).
# Docker is never involved: every architecture-specific piece is downloaded
# from a pinned manifest, so both architectures build on any x86_64 or
# aarch64 host.
