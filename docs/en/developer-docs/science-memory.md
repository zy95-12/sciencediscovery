# ScienceMemory (Task and Citation Chains)

ScienceMemory is an experimental option, on by default for a new data directory (off in the Docker image, which runs no memory-graph service), that records a Session's execution and argumentation as a graph, kept as local text files by default or in Neo4j when selected. Its value is making "where did this conclusion come from" traceable and clickable: from the research goal, to each task, the code run, the files produced, down to each cited Claim in the final report and its supporting Evidence.

Two core chains in the graph:

- **Task chain**: `ResearchGoal → Task → ToolCall → Code/Artifact/Paper`, linked by temporal `next` edges and output `produces` edges; answers "what was done, in what order".
- **Citation chain**: `report Artifact ←stated_in— Claim ←supports— Evidence ←extracts— Paper`, written explicitly by declare tools; answers "what does each sentence in the report cite".

The two intersect at **Claim** and **Artifact** nodes: a Claim both `supports` the Evidence/Artifact backing it and is recorded in the report Artifact via a `stated_in` edge; an Artifact is both a `ToolCall -produces->` product in the task chain and possibly a `supports` target in the citation chain.

## 1. Main modules

ScienceMemory spans four layers, each with its own responsibility:

- **Frontend `apps/web`**: read-only. Renders the graph (thumbnail card + full-screen explorer), turns `[alias]` in reports into clickable chips, and dispatches clicks to evidence/artifact/node details. Does not connect to the graph directly; all read requests go through the Node API.
- **Shared packages `packages`**: `schema` defines cross-package types (nodes/edges, Declare inputs, ComposerReference, report-version references); `agent-runtime` defines the LLM-callable tools (`query_graph` / `declare_*`) and injects the declare flow into the system prompt when the feature is enabled. Together they keep the frontend, Node, and tools from drifting.
- **Control plane `services/api` (Node)**: the only client that connects to the graph directly. Two jobs — ① fire-and-forget mirror writes on execution events and receive LLM tool callbacks for declare; ② reverse-proxy `/api/memory/*` read requests for the browser. Drains chip references onto the report version at persistence time.
- **Graph sidecar `services/memory-graph` (Python)**: FastAPI service on loopback `:17674`, Bearer-authenticated. Turns Node's writes into graph nodes/edges (`persistence.py`) and answers read queries (`query.py`). Both go through one storage seam (`backend.py`) with two implementations: the default local JSONL store (`local_graph.py`, driven by a small Cypher interpreter in `_cypher.py`) and Neo4j. Degrades silently when the selected Neo4j is unreachable, without throwing.

Four-layer flow (separate write and read paths, both via the Node API):

```text
[write] execution event / LLM tool callback ──trigger──> Node API ──fire-and-forget write──> Python sidecar ──Cypher──> local files / Neo4j
[read]  browser ────────────────────────────> Node API ──reverse proxy──────────> Python sidecar ──Cypher──> local files / Neo4j

bypass: agent-runtime defines LLM tools, schema defines cross-package types (constrains tools/types, does not participate in data flow directly)
```

All graph writes originate from the Node API (execution mirroring + declare); the browser is read-only, gateway and runner do not participate; the Python sidecar is only accessed by the Node API — a closed single-client loop.

### 1.1 Node types (9)

| Node label | Represents | Unique key / source |
|------------|------|---------------|
| `ResearchGoal` | This Session's research goal | `goal_id` (deterministically generated on the Node side, idempotent on resend) |
| `Task` | A subagent's scope (one node per subagent run, `task_type='subagent'`) | `task_id` |
| `ToolCall` | One concrete task step — a code execution or a search/fetch call | `task_id` |
| `Code` | A piece of executed code | `code_id` |
| `Artifact` | A produced file version (chart, CSV, the report itself…) | `artifact_id` |
| `Paper` | A literature record | composite `(session_id, link)`, `link` normalized via `_normalize_link` |
| `Evidence` | A piece of evidence extracted from a Paper | `evidence_id` |
| `Claim` | A cited assertion in the report | `claim_id` |
| `SourceFile` | A user-uploaded input file (CSV/image/JSON/PDF…) | `file_id` (deterministic `source_file:session:<sid>:<path>`, idempotent on re-upload) |

### 1.2 Edge types (9)

| Edge | Direction | Meaning | Belongs to | Writer |
|--------|------|------|------|--------|
| `next` | ResearchGoal→head / ToolCall→ToolCall / Task(scope)→first ToolCall | Temporal chain: execution order sorted by `finished_at` (a subagent's scope links to its first child `ToolCall` via `next`) | Task chain | `_link_subtasks_by_finish_time` (rebuild, idempotent) |
| `produces` | ToolCall→Code/Artifact/Paper; Task(scope)→child ToolCall's Code/Artifact | What a task step produced (a subagent's scope produces its child's products, never its own) | Task chain + Citation chain | `upsert_execution` / `upsert_mcp_search` / `declare_claim` |
| `extracts` | Paper→Evidence | Which paper the evidence was extracted from | Citation chain | `declare_evidence` |
| `supports` | Evidence/Artifact→Claim | What backs the assertion | Citation chain | `declare_claim` |
| `stated_in` | Claim→report Artifact | The claim is recorded in this report Artifact | Citation chain (task↔citation intersection) | `declare_claim` (when `artifact_id` passed) / `link_claims_to_report` |
| `supersedes` | Artifact(new)→Artifact(old) | This version replaces its predecessor | Version lineage (task chain) | `upsert_execution` |
| `input` | Artifact(read version)/SourceFile→Code | The code run read this artifact version or uploaded file as an input | Data-dependency (task chain) | `upsert_execution` |
| `contains` | Task(scope)→first child ToolCall | A subagent's scope groups its child task steps | Task chain (subagent scoping) | `_link_subtasks_by_finish_time` |
| `feeds` | SourceFile→ResearchGoal | This uploaded file feeds into this research goal | Upload mirror (task-chain prelude) | `upsert_source_file` (fire-and-forget on upload completion) |

## 2. Main flows

### 2.1 Passive task-chain mirroring (no LLM involved)

The task chain needs no explicit LLM declaration; the Node API mirrors it fire-and-forget to the graph on execution events:

1. **File upload** → `MemoryGraphSink.observeUploadFile` → sidecar `POST /observe/upload-file` → `upsert_source_file`: MERGE `SourceFile` (deterministic `file_id`) + build `SourceFile -[:feeds]-> ResearchGoal`. Mirrored the moment upload completes, fire-and-forget (an unreachable graph = no-op; the upload itself is unaffected). The `ResearchGoal` may not exist yet (a file can be uploaded before the first message); in that case **no placeholder goal node is created** — the file stays dangling (node present, no `feeds` edge) until `upsert_session_first_message` MERGEs the real goal and then attaches every still-dangling SourceFile of the session. Re-uploading the same file hits the same `file_id` and creates no duplicate node.
2. **First user message** → `MemoryGraphSink.observeSessionFirstMessage` → sidecar `POST /observe/session-first-message` → writes `Session` + `ResearchGoal` + `has_goal`.
3. **Each code execution completes** → `observeExecution` → `POST /observe/execution` → `upsert_execution`:
   - MERGE a `ToolCall` (`tool_type='execution'`) + `Code`, build `ToolCall -[:produces]-> Code`;
   - execution diff only records Derivation and CAS; not-yet-declared files are not written to the graph as `produced_artifacts`;
   - call `_link_subtasks_by_finish_time` to rebuild this Session's `next` temporal chain (delete this Session's old `temporal_chain` edges first, then relink: `ResearchGoal → head → … → last`).
4. **Each literature search (MCP) completes** → `observeMcpInvocation` → `POST /observe/mcp-search` → `upsert_mcp_search`: MERGE `ToolCall` (`task_id="subtask:mcp:<invocation_id>"`) + batch MERGE `Paper` (deduped by `(session_id, normalized_link)`, `retrieval_count+1` on hit), build `ToolCall -[:produces]-> Paper`.
5. **A subagent runs** → `observeSubagent` → `POST /observe/subagent` → MERGE a scope `Task` (`task_type='subagent'`); when the subagent performs code executions or MCP searches they are mirrored as child `ToolCall` nodes hung off the scope via `contains` + `next`, with `produces` edges running `scope → child's Code/Artifact` (the scope owns its children's products, never its own).

The lightweight Plan is deliberately not a ResearchGoal authority. It does not rewrite the goal inferred from the first user message; a future goal-correction feature should use a dedicated goal lifecycle instead of coupling Memory to Plan progress snapshots.

Once the task chain forms, the frontend "workspace panel" shows a directed graph that grows with execution: the research goal on top, `ToolCall`s lined up along `next` as a timeline (subagent scopes grouping their child `ToolCall`s via `contains`), each `ToolCall` pointing down via `produces` to its code, files, and literature.

### 2.2 Explicit citation declare (LLM-driven at final report time)

The citation chain is built only when the LLM writes the **final summary report**. The system prompt (`runtime.ts`, injected only when the feature is on) sets three core constraints:

- **Declare only when writing the final report**: intermediate chat / progress replies do not create Claims or enter the graph;
- **Must build a citation chain**: the report must carry clickable `[alias]` chips; a chip-less report is considered incomplete;
- **Silent**: never narrate the graph/tools/nodes/ids to the user.

Two cite paths (a single claim may mix both):

**Path A — literature evidence (`[evidence1]`)**

```text
declare_evidence(content, source_paper_link, locator, evidence_type, …)
  → sidecar checks the Paper exists → CREATE Evidence + extracts→Paper → return evidence_id
declare_claim(content, cites_evidence_aliases={"evidence1": evidence_id}, …)
  → CREATE Claim + supports←Evidence → return chip_map={"evidence1": {kind:"evidence", id, label:"evidence1"}}
report body writes [evidence1]
```

**Path B — code output (`[artifact1]`, no literature)**

```text
run_shell → writes a workspace file and records Derivation/CAS
declare_artifact(path) → registers a Project artifact version and returns artifact_id
  → mirrors the declared version as Code -produces-> Artifact
declare_claim(content, cites_artifact_aliases={"artifact1": artifact_id}, …)
  → CREATE Claim + supports←Artifact → return chip_map={"artifact1": {kind:"artifact", id, label:"artifact1"}}
report body writes [artifact1]
```

> `declare_claim`'s `cites_*_aliases` pair (evidence/artifact) is symmetric by design: the alias is a short token the LLM writes into the report, the corresponding id (evidence_id / artifact_id) resolves in the graph. Code-generated files must first go through `declare_artifact` to get a stable `artifact_id`; undeclared files cannot become graph Artifacts. The final report file itself must also be explicitly declared; at declaration time the round's claims are associated with the report version via `stated_in` edges (Claim → report Artifact).

### 2.3 Frontend rendering and click dispatch

When a report opens (`MarkdownRenderer` + `version.references`), the `remarkGraphChips` plugin turns `[alias]` tokens into `graph://<kind>/<id>` links rendered as clickable buttons (`Markdown.tsx`). `App.tsx`'s `handleChipClick` dispatches by `reference.kind`:

| chip kind | Click behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `evidence` | Opens `EvidenceModal` (shows evidence + the source Paper obtained via `getMemoryChain`) |
| `artifact` | Resolves the stable identity by `artifact_id` in the Project artifact directory → opens `ArtifactModal` to view the chart/data directly |

### 2.4 View chain

`get_chain` is the backend for chain viewing. It is keyed by `kind`, a per-button traversal key looked up in the `_BUTTON_CHAIN_HOPS` table (`query.py`). Each node label exposes its own set of buttons (the `CHAIN_BUTTONS` matrix in `MemoryGraphExplorer.tsx`); each button's `kind` selects a small, directional hop list (a sequence of `(edge, direction, target_label, …)` tuples) that `_walk_hops` expands hop by hop. There is no longer a global `full`/`task`/`artifact` dispatch — every chain is a short, label-specific walk.

| Source label | Buttons (`kind`) | What each walks |
|---|---|---|
| `Task` | `viewPrevTask` / `viewNextTask` | the single nearest `Task` along `next` (in/out, limit 1) |
| `Task` | `viewGoal` | the `next` chain back to `ResearchGoal` (`1..`, variable-length) |
| `Code` | `viewInput` / `viewOutput` / `viewProducingTask` | the Artifact versions this Code read via `input`; the Artifacts it `produces`; the `ToolCall` that produced this Code |
| `Paper` | `viewExtractedEvidence` / `viewCitingClaim` / `viewCitingArtifact` | forward citation chain: `extracts→Evidence`, then `+supports→Claim`, then `+stated_in→report Artifact` |
| `Paper` | `viewSearchingTask` | the `ToolCall` that produced this Paper |
| `Evidence` | `viewSourcePaper` / `viewCitingClaimForEvidence` / `viewCitingArtifactForEvidence` | upstream `extracts←Paper`; downstream `supports→Claim`, `+stated_in→Artifact` |
| `Claim` | `viewCitingEvidenceForClaim` / `viewCitingDbRecordForClaim` / `viewCitingSourceFileForClaim` / `viewContainingArtifact` | the Evidence backing this Claim (`supports` in, label-filtered to `Evidence`); the DbRecord backing it (`supports` in, label-filtered to `DbRecord`); the SourceFile backing it (`supports` in, label-filtered to `SourceFile`) — `supports`-in also reaches Artifact, which has no button here; the report Artifact it is `stated_in` |
| `Artifact` | `viewContainedClaims` / `viewCitingClaimForArtifact` / `viewProducingCode` / `viewCitingEvidenceForArtifact` / `viewCitedPaper` / `viewRelatedTask` | claims `stated_in` this report; claims this Artifact `supports`; the producing `Code`; the multi-hop citation ancestry `stated_in→Claim→supports→Evidence`; the same `+extracts→Paper`; and the full task tail `produces→Code→ToolCall→next→ResearchGoal` |

Directional, hop-by-hop walking keeps each chain short and on one directed path (the nodes each hop reaches seed the next hop, so it traces rather than fans out). A hop that finds nothing empties the whole chain (all-or-nothing), which is why the frontend calls `chain_exists` first to grey out buttons whose chain would be empty. `ResearchGoal` and `ToolCall` expose no chain buttons (they are endpoints of the walks above).

Frontend entry: the **"View this {x} in ScienceMemory"** button in `ScientificArtifacts.tsx` / `EvidenceModal.tsx` (shown only when ScienceMemory is enabled) → opens `MemoryGraphExplorer` with `autoChain`, which on mount calls `getMemoryChain` to expand the entry node, and `chainExists` to light or grey each per-label button. Button text is bilingual, switching with the system language (i18n key prefix `chain.`; the `{x}` placeholder resolves to `chain.product` or `chain.evidence`).

### 2.5 Artifact provenance tracing (trace_provenance, for reviewer specialist)

`get_chain` returns an **undirected subgraph** (walks both upstream and downstream, for humans to view), suited to "chain viewing". When the reviewer specialist checks artifact provenance it needs something else: **an ordered upstream chain + a verdict on whether the chain is broken** — "can this artifact be traced back to ResearchGoal?" This question can't be left for the reviewer to assemble from a subgraph and infer breakpoints itself; the endpoint must give the conclusion directly. That is what `trace_provenance` does.

Key differences from `get_chain`:

| | `get_chain` (chain viewing) | `trace_provenance` (provenance tracing) |
|---|---|---|
| Output | Unordered subgraph `{nodes[], edges[]}` | Ordered linear chain `{chain[], broken, truncated, reason}` |
| Direction | Bidirectional, upstream + downstream | **Fixed upstream** (walks from start toward the source, does not expose direction) |
| Verdict | None | `broken`/`truncated`/`reason` — three provenance signals |
| Consumer | Rendered by the frontend for humans | reviewer specialist derives `decision` from it |

`trace_provenance` reuses `get_chain`'s `_CHAIN_HOPS` hop-by-hop expansion engine, but takes only `direction=="in"` (upstream) entries, recording the node reached each hop + the `via_edge` hop order, and verdicts:

- Reaches `target_label` (default ResearchGoal) → `broken:false`, last hop marked `is_terminal` (chain complete, artifact traceable)
- A hop finds no upstream edge (chain broken) → `broken:true`, `reason` points to the chain-tail node (breakpoint location)
- Reaches `max_hops` (default 8) without reaching the target → `truncated:true` + `broken:false` (chain not broken, just not fully walked; distinct from a broken chain)
- Start node does not exist → HTTP 404 (artifact has no memory at all, worse than broken)
- Graph unreachable → `broken:true` + `reason:"memory_graph_unreachable"`, HTTP 200 (degrades without crashing, consistent with all read endpoints)

The reviewer derives `decision` from the returned `broken`: `broken:false` → `ACCEPT_AND_PROCEED`; `broken:true` or `truncated:true` → `REVISE_AND_RETRY`. **The endpoint only outputs `broken`, not verdict/decision** — the latter is the reviewer agent's internal business, preserving the "only the endpoint, not the specialist's decision logic" boundary.

## 3. API interfaces

ScienceMemory adds three kinds of HTTP interfaces: **sidecar native routes** (Python, loopback `:17674`, Bearer auth), **Node API reverse-proxy routes** (browser entry `:4310`, `/api/memory/*`), and **LLM tool callbacks** (Node-internal, not HTTP-facing for the browser).

### 3.1 Sidecar routes (`services/memory-graph/.../server.py`, Bearer-protected)

**Write / mirror (observe + persist)**

| Method + path | Purpose |
|-------------|------|
| `POST /observe/execution` | Mirrors a code execution → ToolCall + Code; only declared versions replayed after `declare_artifact` carry Artifact + produces; rebuilds the next chain |
| `POST /observe/mcp-search` | Mirrors a literature search → ToolCall + Papers + produces |
| `POST /observe/subagent` | Mirrors a subagent's lifecycle → a scope `Task` (`task_type='subagent'`); its child executions/searches hang off the scope via `contains` + `next` |
| `POST /observe/session-first-message` | Writes Session + ResearchGoal + has_goal |
| `POST /persist/evidence` | CREATE Evidence + extracts→Paper (Paper missing → 422 `source_paper_not_found`) |
| `POST /persist/claim` | CREATE Claim + supports (Evidence/Artifact→Claim) + optional produces + optional stated_in; returns `chip_map`. No supporting target → 422 `no_cites_target` (triggered before the degrade branch, reported even if the graph is down) |
| `POST /persist/stated_in` | MERGE stated_in (Claim→report Artifact); the Artifact may not be mirrored yet, polls and waits up to 10×0.3s |
| `POST /internal/backend` | Selects the storage backend (`local` or `neo4j`) |
| `POST /internal/neo4j-password` | Pushes the Neo4j password + ensure_schema |

**Read / query**

| Method + path | Purpose |
|-------------|------|
| `GET /health` | State: `needs-password`/`degraded`/`healthy` (no auth). The `disabled` state is an API-side concept (the toggle is off), not a sidecar status — the sidecar always runs and reports graph reachability only |
| `GET /subgraph?session_id=` | All nodes + all "meaningful" edges (whitelist: produces/next/extracts/supports/stated_in/supersedes/input/contains; the frontend filters out `supersedes` when drawing, version lineage not in the chain view) |
| `POST /query/match` | Cross-session substring search (ranked by hit count + field priority); `mode=all_terms` term-AND (frontend search box — typing a paper's full title returns just that paper), `mode=any_term` OR (default, the agent `query_graph` tool — loose recall to avoid zero results); `session_id=null` crosses sessions |
| `POST /query/by-node-type` | Filter nodes by label |
| `POST /query/by-edge-type` | Filter by edge type, returns edges + deduped endpoints |
| `POST /query/chain` | Chain traversal (`node_id` + `kind` + optional `session_id`/`version`): `kind` is a button key into `_BUTTON_CHAIN_HOPS` (see §2.4); not found → 404 |
| `POST /query/chain-exists` | Batch existence check for a node's button `kind`s → `{<kind>: bool}`; the frontend uses it to hide buttons whose chain is empty before the user clicks |
| `POST /query/scope-expansion` | Expand a subagent scope `Task` into its child ToolCalls + real produces/contains/next edges (the "click to expand a scope" payload); non-scope id → 404 |
| `POST /query/group-expansion` | Expand a folded aggregate node (multiple Artifacts/Papers of one kind collapsed into one) into its member products |
| `POST /trace/provenance` | Artifact provenance tracing (`node_id` + optional `target_label`/`max_hops`/`session_id`); fixed upstream, returns ordered chain + `broken`/`truncated`/`reason`; start missing → 404 |
| `GET /query/artifact-provenance` | Aggregate one Artifact version's derived-from dependencies via the graph (the four provenance fields stay on the legacy SessionStore endpoint) |

**Cleanup**

| Method + path | Purpose |
|-------------|------|
| `POST /cleanup/session` | Soft-marks that session's Artifacts as session-scoped (keeps nodes, adjusts retention) |
| `POST /cleanup/project` | Physically deletes all of a project's graph nodes (project teardown) |

### 3.2 Node API reverse-proxy routes (`services/api/src/http/`, browser entry)

Browser is read-only, all reverse-proxied to the sidecar; feature off (client=null) returns an empty result + `reason:"memory_graph_disabled"`, sidecar unreachable returns `reason:"memory_graph_unreachable"`:

| Method + path | Client method (`apps/web/src/api/`) |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `GET /api/memory/subgraph?session_id=` | `getMemorySubgraph` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/match` | `queryMemoryMatch` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/by-node-type` | `byMemoryNodeType` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/by-edge-type` | `byMemoryEdgeType` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/chain` | `getMemoryChain` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/chain-exists` | `chainExists` (lights or greys per-label buttons) |
| `POST /api/memory/query/scope-expansion` | `getScopeExpansion` |
| `POST /api/memory/query/group-expansion` | `getGroupExpansion` |
| `POST /api/memory/trace/provenance` | `traceProvenance` (reviewer provenance; returns `broken`/`truncated`/`reason`) |
| `GET /api/memory/query/artifact-provenance` | `getMemoryArtifactProvenance` |
| `GET /health` (includes `memoryGraph` field) | `getMemoryHealth` |

> declare/persist classes are **not on the browser client**: `declareEvidence`/`declareClaim`/`linkClaimsToReport` are Node-internal LLM tool callbacks (see 3.3), calling the sidecar `/persist/*` directly via `MemoryGraphClient`.

### 3.3 LLM tools (`packages/workspace/src/workspace.ts`, registered when the feature is on)

| Tool | Input | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|
| `query_graph` | `{query}` | Substring search on this Session's graph nodes; called at most once, only before the final report to resolve node ids to cite |
| `declare_evidence` | `{content, source_paper_link, locator, evidence_type, confidence, strength}` | Creates Evidence + `extracts` (Paper→Evidence), returns `evidence_id` |
| `declare_claim` | `{content, claim_type, confidence, locator, cites_node_ids[], cites_evidence_aliases{}, cites_artifact_aliases{}, cites_artifact_versions{}, artifact_id?, artifact_version?, task_id?}` | Creates Claim + `supports` (Evidence/Artifact→Claim) + optional produces/stated_in, returns `chip_map` (alias→{kind,id,label}) |
| `trace_provenance` | `{node_id, target_label?, max_hops?}` | Traces artifact provenance: returns an ordered upstream chain + `broken`/`truncated`/`reason`. The reviewer specialist derives `decision` from it, no need to assemble the chain itself |

These tools are grouped in `RunTimeline` under `GRAPH_TOOL_NAMES = {query_graph, declare_evidence, declare_claim}`. The system prompt also constrains: declare/query steps are **silent**, never narrated to the user.

> **`trace_provenance` is visible differently from the other three**: `query_graph`/`declare_*` are registered for all workspaces when ScienceMemory is enabled; `trace_provenance` is registered only when the **reviewer specialist is active** (`reviewerSpecialistAvailable(enabled, message)` gating: the user message contains "reviewer specialist" + the toggle is on), invisible to the main agent otherwise. Its description also carries a RESTRICTED USE constraint (only for provenance review, no exploration) — double insurance against misuse, because the reviewer specialist is currently a "main agent + gated tool" model (not a separate subagent), so after activation the main agent can still see the tool.

## 4. Storage

ScienceMemory's own data lives in the graph store (local JSONL files by default, or Neo4j), but to support chip rendering and surviving refreshes, the existing Node-side storage model was extended with fields:

### 4.1 Node-side file-storage extensions

| Location | Addition |
|------|----------|
| `.sciencediscovery-data/scientific-artifacts/` (catalog) | `ScientificArtifactVersion.references?: ComposerReference[]` — the report version's chip alias→graph node mapping, letting chips survive refresh (`store/catalog.ts`) |
| Project artifact directory | `ScientificArtifact` stores the stable `artifact_id`, `projectId`, `origin`, and the creating Session snapshot; `ScientificArtifactVersion` stores the CAS reference and source path |
| Report version | At `declare_artifact` persistence, drains `chipMapBuffer`→`references` + `claimIds`→`stated_in` edges |
| `ComposerReferenceKind` | Extended to `artifact | session | skill | paper | evidence | claim`, carrying the chip's kind |

### 4.2 Environment variables

Connection, auth, and log variables for the sidecar and Node client:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|------|------|------|
| `SCIENCE_AGENT_MEMORY_GRAPH_HOST` / `_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `17674` | Sidecar bind address and port (service process) |
| `SCIENCE_AGENT_MEMORY_GRAPH_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:17674` | Endpoint the Node API client uses to reach the sidecar (trailing slash trimmed) |
| `SCIENCE_AGENT_MEMORY_GRAPH_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `sciencediscovery-memory-graph-local` | Sidecar Bearer token; verified by both Node and sidecar |
| `SCIENCE_AGENT_MEMORY_GRAPH_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log level shared by the sidecar and the Node side (propagated) |

> Enabling ScienceMemory, the storage backend (Local files or Neo4j), and, for Neo4j, the connection address, user, and password are all managed in **System Settings → ScienceMemory** (single toggle; no `.env` edit or stack restart needed).

Startup: `scripts/start-stack.sh` unconditionally launches the sidecar with `.sciencediscovery-data/envs/memory-graph/bin/python -m sciencediscovery_memory_graph.server` (the environment is provisioned unconditionally with the stack) and `wait_healthy` waits for `http://127.0.0.1:17674/health`. When the toggle is off the sidecar runs idle; sink writes and read paths short-circuit to return `memory_graph_disabled`.
