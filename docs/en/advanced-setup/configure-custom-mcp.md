# Configure custom MCP servers, OAuth and Inspector

[中文](../../zh/advanced-setup/configure-custom-mcp.md) | [REST API](../reference/rest-api.md)

This guide covers custom MCP management in system settings. Existing built-in sources remain available in their own tab and do not need to be added again.

## Before you start

- Start the product and connect your browser using the `Open to sign in` URL (or the local service access token) printed by the backend.
- Obtain the MCP provider's startup command or remote MCP URL and authentication requirements. An MCP URL is not an ordinary web page or an OpenAI-compatible LLM base URL.
- STDIO runs on the API backend machine, not the browser machine, and does not automatically enter the Session sandbox. Configure only trusted commands and install the required runtime there. With Docker, executable paths and dependencies must be available inside the container.

## Add and manage a server

1. Open system settings, select **MCP servers**, open **Custom**, and choose **Add server**.
2. Enter a name and optional description, select a transport, and complete its fields.
3. Set **Tool timeout (seconds)**. The default is 60, with an allowed integer range of 1-600. This timeout cannot be disabled.
4. **Enable this MCP server** at the top controls the entire server and is unchecked for a new configuration. You can also toggle it in the list after saving.
5. Click the server name to expand its initially collapsed details, then select **Test connection**. Inspect the discovered tools, descriptions and input schemas, or correct the reported error and retry.

| Transport | Fields |
|---|---|
| STDIO | Executable in Command; one argument per line in Arguments; optional working directory and environment variables |
| Streamable HTTP | Provider's MCP URL and its required request headers or OAuth settings |
| SSE | Provider's SSE endpoint and its required request headers or OAuth settings |

For a server started by `node /opt/research-mcp/server.mjs`, enter the backend's `node` executable path in Command and `/opt/research-mcp/server.mjs` as one Arguments line. This is an illustrative path, not a bundled service. Do not enter an entire shell command in Command.

Testing a disabled server does not enable it, but STDIO testing does start the configured program. Deleting a server removes its configuration, connector references and local authorization; it does not uninstall the program.

### Import JSON

Choose **Import JSON** and provide a `mcpServers` object, for example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Research MCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
      "timeoutSeconds": 60
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the placeholder URL with the actual endpoint. The whole batch is validated before saving, and imported entries are disabled until you enable them. Duplicate names are rejected; at most 50 custom servers can be saved. Never include real credentials in public issues, screenshots or shared configurations.

## Secret request headers and environment variables

For HTTP/SSE, select **None / request headers** and add headers such as `Authorization` as required by the provider. STDIO accepts environment variables. Values are encrypted on the backend; reopening the editor shows **Saved value**, not plaintext.

- Leaving a saved key and value unchanged retains the secret.
- Renaming a saved key requires re-entering its value; saving is blocked until you do so. The old secret is not automatically copied to the new name.
- If you only changed the key, restoring its original name retains the saved value without re-entry.
- Explicitly editing and clearing a value without renaming the key saves an empty string, rather than retaining the old value. Removing the row removes that entry.

For direct API clients, `null` retains a value only under the exact same key. See [REST API](../reference/rest-api.md) for replacement and deletion semantics. This fix cannot recover credentials already cleared by an older version; obtain and enter them again from their original provider.

## Sign in with OAuth

OAuth applies to HTTP/SSE, not STDIO. Remote OAuth endpoints require HTTPS; loopback HTTP is allowed for development.

1. Select **OAuth** under Authentication and remove any manually configured Authorization header.
2. Supply Client ID, Client Secret and Scope as required by the provider. Leave Client ID empty only when the provider supports an appropriate registration flow. A nonempty Client Secret requires a Client ID.
3. If using a client metadata URL, provide an accessible HTTPS metadata document. The product accepts the URL but does not host that document for you.
4. Check the displayed callback URL and, when required, register that exact address with the provider. `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, different domains and ports are not interchangeable.
5. Save, then choose **Sign in** in server details and complete consent in the new window. If the popup is blocked, use **Open login page**.
6. Return to the product, check the authorization state, and test discovery and tool execution. You can sign in again or cancel a pending attempt.

Tokens are stored and refreshed by the backend. Do not paste them into the local service access token field or manually copy them to request headers. Invalid refresh tokens, insufficient scope or configuration changes may require another sign-in. **Clear local authorization** removes this product's saved credentials, not consent at the provider; revoke provider-side access in the provider's own settings.

Registration policies, scopes, callback allowlists and account permissions differ between providers. OAuth support does not imply universal zero-configuration compatibility.

## Test tools with Inspector

1. Open a Session in a Project, enable the MCP server and discover its tools with Test connection.
2. Expand its details and open **MCP Inspector**. Check the associated Session.
3. Select a tool, inspect its description and input schema, then fill in the JSON arguments.
4. Execute and inspect success/failure, duration, raw response and normalized result. Copy the result or expand and copy the invocation record ID.
5. While running, you can cancel waiting and invoke again later. Cancellation cannot guarantee reversal of side effects already performed remotely.

Inspector performs real tool calls, not simulations, and does not call an LLM to fill arguments. Understand whether a tool writes or deletes data before executing it. A Session is required for the existing invocation audit chain; execution is unavailable without one or while the server is disabled. This tools-focused UI is not a full embedding of the official standalone Inspector and does not provide a complete resources/prompts browser.

## Allow the Agent to use tools

Enable the MCP in the target Session's connector selection. Global server enablement and the Session's effective connector selection are separate requirements. A Session may inherit Project/global settings; inspect its effective selection rather than assuming every Session starts with an empty list.

The Agent decides whether a task needs a tool, so selection does not force a call on every message. Manual Inspector execution does not change the Session's connector selection or authorize its Agent to use every tool.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Connection guide opens or shows Unauthorized | The local service access token, not the MCP provider token or external model API Key; open the backend's `Open to sign in` URL or paste the current backend's access token |
| STDIO cannot start | Executable, arguments, working directory and dependencies on the backend machine/container |
| HTTP/SSE authentication failure | MCP URL, header names/values, OAuth state and provider permissions |
| Save blocked after renaming a key | Re-enter the value, or restore the original key if the value was not edited |
| OAuth callback fails | Application origin and registered callback match; authorization has not expired or been cancelled |
| Connection succeeds but a tool fails | Input schema, scope, tool permissions and timeout; discovery does not prove every tool can execute |
